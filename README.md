# Year 2 of developing videogames in my high school

Me, and some random guys of my high school we made a GAME. But it was sooooo long and desespariting.

This guys were: 

<ul>
  <li><b>Aran Roig</b> (me)</li>
  <li><b>Xabi Barranco</b> (loves the Nintendo Switch)</li>
  <li><b>Pau Goba</b></li>
  <li><b>Juanma</b></li>
</ul>

Now we have another one! (I don't remember his name, so I will update this readme.md), and we started a project from scratch <b>again</b>.

We want to make a game for Android (compiling with the Android tools in Unity will be very cool, because everybody on our high school can install it), that
is like a linear non-ending game (idk how to call it), just some type of Subway Surfers.

This project will take a <b>long</b> time to develop. So, let's see if I can get this done before Fortnite season 10.
